# Deep-ML Solutions

A collection of my solutions to machine learning problems from [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/).

## 🚀 Overview

This repository serves as a structured archive for machine learning algorithms and concepts I've implemented. Each solution is organized into its own directory for clarity and modularity.

## 📂 Project Structure

Each problem follows a standard structure:

```text
deepml_solns/
├── <problem-name>/
│   ├── <code-file>  # Implementation of the ML algorithm
│   └── README.md    # Theory, learning summary, and personal insights
└── ...
```

- **Code:** Python implementation of the algorithm.
- **README:** Personal reflections, theoretical background, and key takeaways in my own words.

## 📝 Blog Integration

For every major problem solved, I also maintain a detailed blog post on my [portfolio website](https://yashjayswal24.github.io/portfolio/). These posts include professional descriptions, tags, and highlights of my learning journey.

## 🛠️ Automated Workflow

This repository utilizes a custom agent workflow to:
1. Initialize new problem folders.
2. Generate structured READMEs with theoretical insights.
3. Synchronize with my website's blog posts.
4. Manage Git commits and deployments.
